# planeworld

Planeworld environment simulates plane objects in a grid moving towards a goal. Planes spawn from the edge of the grid and aim to move towards the centre. Each plane moves individually and all planes move simultaneously in a time-step. The aim is to get all planes to the goal without colliding with each other.
